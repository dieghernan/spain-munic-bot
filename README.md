## A Twitter bot written in R

<p align="center">

</p>

I tweet a random map of a Spanish town together with its name, province, and
autonomous community (and a inset map of Spain showing the region and the
community). The bot is set to run every 20 minutes.

## [I have a website!!](https://dieghernan.github.io/spain-munic-bot/)

## **:house: Buildings**

I create a map of the Urban Growth of Spanish cities, based on the works of
**Dominic Roy√©:** [Visualize urban growth](https://dominicroye.github.io/en/2019/visualize-urban-growth/)

![sample](/assets/img/sample.png)

Find [here](https://dieghernan.github.io/spain-munic-bot/journey) all the maps
generated by the bot.

## :package: R packages

Core packages used in the project are:

-   [{CatastRo}](https://ropenspain.github.io/CatastRo/) for the buildings.
-   [{mapSpain}](https://ropenspain.github.io/mapSpain/) for the location of the
    municipalities.
-   [{ggplot2}](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) for plotting,
-   [{rtweet}](https://docs.ropensci.org/rtweet/) for posting,

Other packages used are {sf}, {dplyr} and another common supporting packages.

This project uses {renv} for ensuring fully reproducibility across platforms.

## :grey_question: How to run it

From the command line it is enough to run the following command:

        $ Rscript R/trigger.R

This will trigger `R/01_create_map.R` and compose the tweet.
